ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @gonardu

I'm an Arduino specialist, and I do some interesting work, including AI projects. 
Currently, I'm learning IoT and how to use the ESP32 effectively to achieve the best results. 
I'm collaborating on some eco-friendly projects.

You can reach me via email (preferably in Spanish) at gonzalo.gravenhorst@philips.edu.ar.

The main tools I use for my projects are Arduino IDE and Python. The software you may need (with some exceptions) will be:
- Arduino IDE
- Microsoft Visual Basic
